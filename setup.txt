Created a Laravel 11 project and configured a MySQL database in .env.

Built a users table with required fields using migrations and applied indexes for better performance.

Implemented user registration and login with:
Client-side validation using Parsley.js
Server-side validation using Laravel validation rules

After registration, sent a verification code via email using Mailtrap.

Used Laravel Jobs & Queues to send emails in the background for faster performance.

User enters the verification code to activate the account.

Upon successful verification, redirected user to the booking process with a form.
Implemented logic for Full Day, Half Day, and Custom timings.

After booking, users can view all their bookings.
